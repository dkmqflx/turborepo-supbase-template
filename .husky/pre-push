# This is a pre-push hook that will run before you push to the remote repository.
# It will check if the branch is main or dev and if it is, it will exit with a message.
# This is to prevent you from pushing to the main or dev branch.
# if you want to prevent pushing to the main or dev branch, you can activate the above code.
